# Parametric Design and GDO Analysis of Gear Pump

This project involves the parametric design of a gear pump housing, modeled in SolidWorks and structurally analyzed using ANSYS.

## 📌 Project Overview

- Created 9 different design variations.  
- Analyzed parameters including weight, maximum stress, and maximum displacement.  
- Applied Goal Driven Optimization (GDO) to identify the optimal design.

## 🧪 Tools Used

- SolidWorks (modeling)  
- ANSYS Student (analysis)  
- Excel (DOE table and result analysis)
