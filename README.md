# Parametric Design Analysis and Optimization of External Gear Pumps
This study focuses on the parametric design, structural analysis, and optimization of an external gear pump. Key design variables such as wall thickness and bolt hole diameter were evaluated to minimize weight while ensuring mechanical strength, using SolidWorks and ANSYS.
